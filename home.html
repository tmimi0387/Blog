        <p>Front End Web Developer</p>

        <br>
        <p>Being the mother of seven children, and wife to a self-proclaimed foodie, I am always cooking. Spending a lot of time with both my immediate and extended family as well as the many Italian families that lived near me as a child, cooking became a passion of mine. That is how this blog came to be. I can mix that passion of feeding others with my burning desire to be a front end web developer. You, my lovelies, get to enjoy all the recipes I've learned along the years while I get the satisfaction of building this website from scratch.</p>
