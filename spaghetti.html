                        This is my go to meal for my family when I'm in a rush, but also want to make something hearty. Originally, this was my husband's recipe. However, after a few tweeks I've perfected it and made it my own. The kids love it and so do my husband and I.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I make this a couple times a month for my family and they have never been disappointed. Occasionally, I do change the type of noodles I use just to keep it new and fresh. So one time I'll use regular spaghetti noodles, and the next time I make it I'll use penne or macaroni noodles and top this with shredded cheese, pop it in the oven for half and hour and make some rigatoni. Using different noodles just makes it seem like it's a different meal. This recipe can also be doubled and made for a large crowd.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The best part about this recipe is that most of the ingredients are already in your pantry. Most of you will already have the seasonings on hand. And, if you're anything like me, then you have noodles in your pantry as well.
