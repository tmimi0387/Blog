                I am a wife, mother, and a self-professed foodie. I love cooking and feeding people. I am intoxicated by the atmosphere that's created when a group of individuals sit down to share a meal. Hence, why I want to share my recipes with the world. Growing up around Italians, my food is mostly inspired by Italian cuisine. Apart from my affinity for cooking, my deepest desire for many years has been to learn front end web development. The idea of taking an idea and turning it into a website is enormously tantalizing to me. Like the sea calls to Moana, designing and developing webpages calls to me. I hope that me sharing my passions with you inspires you to follow your own dreams. As Tony Sorenson said, <q>The world is yours the moment you follow your own dreams.</q>

                Baked macaroni and cheese is one of my favorite side dishes to make. It seems daunting at first, but it is actually an easy process. Although, I will be honest, it does take some time and patience. The ease of making it is not why it's my favorite side dish, though. What makes this my favorite side dish is that it works for almost any occasion. It can be made for backyard barbeques, holiday meals, birthday parties, and just about any other event you can think of. Plus, the cheeses can be substituted for any kind you like and just that one simple change will greatly change the flavor and consistency of the cheese. You can have a dish that's either extremely cheesy or one that has the perfect balance of cheese to noodle ratio. The possibilities are endless, even I alter the recipe every time I make it.

            <h3 class="list-name">Directions</h3>
            <ol class="full-list">
                <li><b>Cook the Macaroni - </b>Cook macaroni according to package directions. The macaroni will continue to cook after it is placed in the oven so be sure to cook it until it is "al dente" or almost done. The noodles will also continue to cook after being strained, so I shock my noodles by running them under cold water after straining them.</li><br>
                <li><b>Make the cheese sauce - </b>Add butter to a saucepan and let melt, when the butter is melted add milk and allow this mixture to heat until hot but not boiling. Lower the heat to low and add the cheeses into this mixture saving a handful of each of the shredded cheeses for the top layer. Stir frequently until all the cheeses are melted.</li><br>
                <li><b>Season and thicken the sauce - </b>Season the cheese sauce to your preferred tasting and then add the egg and stir. The egg thickens the cheese sauce, so it's important to make sure you season the sauce completely before adding the egg or it might become difficult to stir.</li><br>
                <li><b>Mix together - </b>Mix the noodles with the cheese sauce in a large baking dish making sure to completely mix them together. Since the egg thickened the sauce this will take some time and effort, so be patient.</li><br>
                <li><b>Top layer - </b>Use the remaining shredded cheeses to add a top layer of cheese. An alternative to this if you don't want the top cheesy layer is to sprinkle panko or regular breadcrumbs on top for a more crispy top layer.</li><br>
                <li><b>Bake and Enjoy - </b>I bake mine covered on 350&deg;F for 15 minutes and then remove the cover and bake an additional 15 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes to cool and enjoy </li><br>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Feel free to alter any part of this recipe you like. If you prefer something less cheesy than either use less cheese or more noodles. The top layer can be ommitted and the macaroni and cheese will still be flavorful. You can change the kinds of cheeses you use and change the milk. Or you can increase/decrease the amount of milk used. It really is up to you. Also, to be quite honest, I never measure out my ingredients and neither does anyone I know. You can Google baked macaroni recipes right now, and the majority of those recipes will not have measurements on them. These reasons are why baked macaroni is both versatile and easy to make. <span class="last-span">You are only limited by your imagination.</span>
