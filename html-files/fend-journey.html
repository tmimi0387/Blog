                I am a wife, mother, and a self-professed foodie. I love cooking and feeding people. I am intoxicated by the atmosphere that's created when a group of individuals sit down to share a meal. Hence, why I want to share my recipes with the world. Growing up around Italians, my food is mostly inspired by Italian cuisine. Apart from my affinity for cooking, my deepest desire for many years has been to learn front end web development. The idea of taking an idea and turning it into a website is enormously tantalizing to me. Like the sea calls to Moana, designing and developing webpages calls to me. I hope that me sharing my passions with you inspires you to follow your own dreams. As Tony Sorenson said, <q>The world is yours the moment you follow your own dreams.</q>

                I've always heard that front-end web development was easier than back-end, so I thought learning it would be a piece of cake. Especially since I had spent some time on my own learning HTML5 and CSS3, boy was I wrong. Learning through Udacity has opened my eyes to all the things I didn't know I didn't know. Of course, learning HTML and CSS is easier than learning a high-level programming language such as JavaScript, Python or C++. However, there are still challenges to learning and executing. Challenges that have me referring back to my learning material, and Google, a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
                One good thing about this time is that it has been way more informative. Yes, learning all these new concepts that I've never heard of before has been difficult. Fortunately, the material has been broken down into bite-sized pieces to make it easier to absorb the information. I also found it very useful that we, as students, had a workspace where we could practice what we just learned. This was extremely beneficial to me because I learn by doing, not merely reading or watching videos. The better learning experience is why I'm writing this in the first place. I wanted to chronicle what I learned in the past, from a reputable company, compared to what I'm learning now. Also, what I hope to learn in the future.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <figure class="left-figure">
                <img src="../images/html.jpg" alt="html icon"/>
                <figcaption>HTML icon and some HTML tags</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>As I said, I've taken the time to learn some HTML in the past, but this time was so much more intense and informative. You see, in the past I learned the basics. I learned that you had to start each HTML file with &lt!DOCTYPE&gt and &lthtml&gt. How each HTML file had to have header and body sections, and that the title of the webpage goes inside the head section.  Additionally, I have been well versed in the tags p, h1-h6, span, div, ul, ol and li. Tags used for things such as paragraphs, ordered lists, unordered lists, list items, etc. However, what I've never knew is how to use &lthr&gt to add a line across the page, and using a section tag to indicate a new section in the file. There are so many elements that I never knew of before. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the things I hope to learn is how to embed audio into the HTML file. Something else I found intriguing is the tag canvas ( &ltcanvas&gt ) that is used to to draw graphics by using JavaScript.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <figure class="right-figure" >
                <img src="../images/css.jpg" alt="css icon">
                <figcaption>An example of CSS</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                CSS is used to style the HTML file that you created. You can use it to add colors to your font, make the text bigger or smaller, and even make the entire webpage different colors. It's how you make certain parts of your webpage move to different areas of the page, and how to make pictures a different size. Those are all things I've already known. What I've recently discovered is that you can use CSS Grid to make a layout for the webpage. Grid can even be used inside another grid. For example, if I set one element to be in the center of the page, I than can insert another grid into the center of the page to split it into four sections. Another thing I found out is how to select multiple elements to be styled at once. Plus, I never knew there were so many different ways to use CSS Flexbox. This time learning is also the first time I had ever heard of what an avatar is, let alone how to make one with CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hopefully, I can learn more about Grid and minmax width. There are honestly so many features in CSS, too many to list on one page, and I want to learn about all the them. Of course, it will be hard to remember everything, but I still want to learn as much as I can. Remembering everything by heart will be impossible, as I've learned even experts don't remember everything off the top of their heads, but that doesn't deter me from wanting to find out.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <figure class="left-figure">
                <img src="../images/js.png" alt="snippet of JavaScript code">
                <figcaption>JavaScript code example</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                This is one area where I don't have any prior experience. I tried to take an online course that would allow me to learn at my own pace, unfortunately, it was the hardest experience of my life. It was so difficult because, as I mentioned earlier, I learn best by doing and not by just reading or watbhing videos on the subjects. The company that I went through only supplied videos and the videos weren't very helpful for the assignment they would give. For example, we would watch a three to four minute video explaining what a function is and the basics of how to write one, and then we would have to write a function that could display the information to a song of our choosing. The information had to include song name, artist, duration, genre and producer. We had no guidance on how to complete this assignment and I didn't want to cheat, so I quit the program.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I hope to learn JavaScript in a way that is effective and conducive to my learning style. Given the platform thus far I don't think that will be a problem. And, I can't wait to be able to make websites more interactive. Don't get me wrong, with regular HTML and CSS you can put some interaction in there between the site and the user. However, as far as my understanding is, that interaction is limited to clicking on links and filling out forms.
